            Cyber Monday - Ubiqiti Networks Alternative
        </h1>

        <p>
            From the previous blog post - <a href="/week7/index.html">Ubiquiti Consumer Products – Final Part</a>, I wrote about the Unifi Amplifi Instant and Amplifi Teleport, which is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for Unifi Amplifi product. The Amplifi Instant is a more affordable consumer networking product than the Amplifi HD one. It is designed for daily computing basic tasks such as surfing web, checking email, and working with documents on the cloud. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            For this upcoming Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there is going to be a lot of discount on electronics, especially networking products. Therefore, it is going to be a perfect time to get a new networking device for your home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all people have the same preference on choosing networking products due to their needs and budget. However, there are other networking products that can be an alternative to Ubiquiti consumer mesh wireless networking products.

                Netgear Orbi Mesh Wireless Network
            </h2>
            <img id="netgear" src="/imgs/week8-1.png" alt="Netgear Orbi"><br>

            <p>
                Figure 1 shows what Netgear Orbi Mesh Wireless Network looks like. You can purchase it for <strong>$243.00 USD</strong> on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Orbi-Ultra-Performance-Whole-System/dp/B01K4CZOBS/ref=sxin_2_ac_d_rm?ac_md=4-3-bmV0Z2VhciBvcmJp-ac_d_rm&keywords=netgear&pd_rd_i=B01K4CZOBS&pd_rd_r=84cbfba4-b3cd-4192-968f-6f6316cd93da&pd_rd_w=gh1dv&pd_rd_wg=uYYkC&pf_rd_p=e2f20af2-9651-42af-9a45-89425d5bae34&pf_rd_r=C7J2FJCCK6F7SP9F4902&psc=1&qid=1574464416">Amazon.com</a>. The Netgear Orbi comes with 2-pack. One is Orbi Router (AC 3000), and the other one is AC3000 Tri-Band Wifi. You can also add more AC3000 Tri-Band Wifi to increase more of the wireless signal coverage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Netgear Orbi is designed to have the rectangular shape facing up, which allows its wireless antennas to focus all of their energy point to a direction that they are facing. Netgear claims that the Orbi can coverage wireless signal up to 5000 square feet. The coverage is very good since most of the American’s houses are around that size.

                <h3>Installation</h3>
                <p>Similar to Ubiquiti consumer networking products, the set up require downloading an application for either <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netgear-orbi/id1182184397?mt=8">iPhone</a> devices or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dragonflow.android.orbi&hl=en">Android</a> devices.

                <p>When the application is downloaded, plug in all the Orbi networking devices to begin setup. The LED indicator will show solid blue when Orbi networking devices are ready to configure. Next, open the Orbi application and follow the prompt to finish setting up Orbi devices.</p>

                <p>To optimize the network performance, the Orbi Router should be placed in a center of a house, and the other Orbi devices can scatter evenly from the Orbi Router similar to the Figure 3, which from Ubiquiti Amplifi HD setup.</p>
