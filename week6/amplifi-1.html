        <p>
            From the last <a href="https://ngocdai94.github.io/week5/1-review.html">review post</a>, I reviewed about the Ubiquiti Enterprise Networking products, how to setup a general Ubiquiti system, and what is a good operating system to use with Ubiquiti Networks. Ubiquiti Networks make most their networking products as an enterprise grade, which means that the devices are extremely well-made and can operating under stress condition such as extremely hot and cold environment. For these reasons, the enterprise grade networking products are expensive.

                To reach more customers, Ubiquiti has been making consumer grade products, which are call <a href="https://amplifi.com/">Unifi Amilifi Wi-Fi.</a> There are two versions of Amlifi Wi-Fi, which are Amlifi Wi-Fi standard and Amlifi Wi-Fi Gaming. The Amlifi Wi-Fi Gaming version are going to be discussed in the Part 2 of the blog. You can follow that post here.

                Figure 1 below shows what Unifi Amlifi Wi-Fi look like. The square one is called a router, which is also a main networking device to get Internet data and transfer the data to clients via wireless receivers, which are the ones on each side of the router.

                What is Amplifi Wi-Fi?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Amplifi Wi-Fi is a whole house Wi-Fi. Basically, it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">mesh wireless network </a>, where a main Wi-Fi networking device is placed at a center of the house to send data such as Internet to other wireless network receivers. Figure 2 below shows how mesh wireless network is setup. Then, the receivers will relay the data back to connected devices. The mesh wireless network is designed to have the wireless signal to cover every single spot of the house so that homeowners and their family can experience a fast-wireless network everywhere they go in their house.
