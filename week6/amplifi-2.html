            Ubiqiti Unifi Amplifi Wi-Fi Gamer's Edition
        </h1>

        <p>
            From <a href="https://ngocdai94.github.io/week6/amplifi-1.html">part 1</a> of Ubiquiti Networks Consumer Products, I shared about Unifi Amplifi Wi-Fi, which is a mesh wireless network. Similar to Unifi Enterprise Networking products, Amplifi Wi-Fi’s purpose is to improve wireless experience in a whole house for homeowners and their family. In other words, it means that no matter what where users go in their house, their mobile devices will be always connected to their home Internet.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Unifi Amplifi Wi-Fi I discussed in part 1 is a standard version, which is good for general purposes such as streaming and surfing web pages. However, for gaming Amplifi Wi-Fi is not fast enough. For this reason, Ubiquiti Networks make another version of Amplifi Wi-Fi, which is <a href="https://amplifi.com/gamers-edition">Amplifi Wi-Fi Gamer’s Edition</a>.

            <p>
                Figure 1 above shows how Amplifi Wi-Fi Gamers’ Edition look like. At a glance, the Gamer’s Edition looks identical to the standard version except for its black color. However, the Gamer’s Edition has some outstanding features such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/products/geforce-now/">Nvidia Geforce Now</a> game optimization, long range, high density, and 270 degrees antenna rotation (figure 2 below).

            <p>
                Ubiquiti claims that the Gamer’s Edition has a higher performance boost than the standard one by 5 times, which allows low latency while gaming.

                Setup
            </h2>
            <p>
                Setting the Gamer’s Edition is similar to the standard one, the central networking unit, which is the square one connecting to the Internet modem, is place in a center of a house. Then, the other two antennas are distributed evenly on each side of the house to create an optimum wireless network. Of course, if homeowner’s house is bigger than the coverage of the Amplifi, they can purchase more antennas to place around their house to have more wireless signal coverage.            </p>
