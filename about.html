            <div>
                <h3>What is Ubiquiti Network?</h3>

                <p>
                    Enterprise networking products are usually very expensive. However, Ubiquiti Network has been going out of their way to make their networking products afforable.

                </p>
    
                <p>

                <h3>What is Ubiquiti Surveillance System?</h3>
                <p>
                    Ubiquiti Surveillance System is a Network Video Recording (NVR) system that involves <a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-poe/">Unifi Power Over Ethernet (PoE) Switches</a> to power <a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-video/unifi-video-camera-g3/">PoE Cameras</a>, a Linux Server, and storage where video recording can store on it. There are two Ubiquiti Surveillance systems, which are Unifi Protect and Unifi Video.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Unifi Protect, which is running on <a href="https://unifi-protect.ui.com/cloud-key-gen2">Unifi Cloud Key Gen2 Plus</a>, is  designed for small houses and businesses. It’s very compact. However, there’s a limit on how many devices that can be put on the Unifi Protect
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    In the other hand, Unifi Video is more flexible than Unifi Protect. It’s a hardware based device on a Linux server. In short, the server can handle a lot of  Unifi Cameras as long as the server is strong enough.
