            From the previous  <a href="/week6/amplifi-1.html">Ubiquiti Consumer Products – Part 1</a> and <a href="/week6/amplifi-2.html">Ubiquiti Consumer Products – Part 2</a>, I shared about the <a href="https://amplifi.com/amplifi-hd">Unifi Amplifi HD</a> and <a href="https://amplifi.com/gamers-edition">Unifi Amplifi Nvidia Edition</a>, which are high-end home mesh wireless networking products made by Ubiquiti Network.
        </p>
        <p> 
            In this final part of Ubiquiti Networks Consumer Products series, I will discuss another version of mesh wireless networking, which is also made by Ubiquiti Networks, called <a href="https://amplifi.com/instant">Unifi Amplifi Instant</a>. Also, I will discuss about one of the exclusive features on the Amplifi products called <a href="https://amplifi.com/teleport">Amplifi Teleport</a>.

            <p>
                Similar to Unifi Amplifi HD and Unifi Amplifi Nvidia Edition, Amplifi Instant is also a mesh wireless network made by Ubiquiti Networks. The main purpose of the mesh wireless network is to create a dead spot free environment so that every device in a house or in a small office can connect to the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unifi Instant is a simplified version of Unifi Amplifi. It is designed for users who do not need a strong wireless environment for gaming and streaming. It is also designed for users who have zero experience in networking to setup the Amplifi Instant wireless mesh network via Ubiquiti mobile application.            
            </p>

            <h2>How to Setup Unifi Amplifi Instant</h2>
            <p>Amplifi Instant comes in a 2-pack package. One of the Amplifi Instant is called Amplifi Instant Router, which has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network">Wire Area Network (WAN)</a> port. The other one is called Amplifi Instant Mesh, which only has an ethernet port and power supply port. Of course, you can add as many as Amplifi Instant Mesh to match your house’s square-foot.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Connect the power cable and ethernet cable to the Unifi Amplifi Instant Router is shown in Figure 2.</li>

                <li>To connect the Amplifi Instant Mesh to the Amplifi Router, simply plug the power cable of the Amplifi Instant Mesh as shown in Figure 3, and it will be automatically discovered by the Amplifi Router.</li>

            <h2> 
                Amplifi Instant Specifications and Comparisons to other Unifi Amplifi versions
            </h2>
            <p>As mention above, Amplifi Instant is a mesh network solution for users who do not do a lot of streaming and gaming. Its performance is weaker than Unifi Amplifi and Unifi Amplifi Nvidia Edition. Figure 6 shows specification of Amplifi Instant, Unifi Amplifi, and Unifi Amplifi Nvidia Edition.</p>

            <h2>Amplifi Teleport – A Feature of Virtual Private Network</h2>
            
            <p>Amplifi Teleport is a software application that can turn any Unifi Amplifi products to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">virtual private network (VPN)</a> tunnel so that users can access to the network environment securely from external networks. Figure 7 shows what user interface of the Amplifi Teleport looks like on iPhone.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, there is a lot of VPN companies such as ExpressVPN, NordVPN, NortonVPN, etc. try to promote their VPN services to protect data privacy for home users. Most of these VPN services are monthly subscription. When using VPN, home users’ Router gateway is reconfigured to hide it Internet Protocol (IP) address. This could cause a problem to users who want to access their data or watch a video surveillance system from external networks.</p>

            <p>However, with Amplifi Teleport, no matter how a Router gateway is configured, Amplifi Teleport will always ensure that users can connect to their home network securely by using Amplifi Teleport VPN. Figure 8 demonstrates how Amplifi Teleport works.</p>

            <h2>How to use it?</h2>
            <p>To use Amplifi Teleport, simply download the Amplifi Teleport mobile application for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/amplifi-teleport/id1464513475">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubnt.teleport">Android</a> mobile devices.
