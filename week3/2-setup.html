               Network Schematic
            </h3>
            <p>
               The schematic below is an example of how all the Ubiquiti devices are connected together for a small business. To get easy to follow the schematic, it has been colored code to reflect a physical ethernet connection among devices. The orange lines are the 100 Mbps ethernet connections, the blue ones are 1 Gbps ethernet connections, the green one is 10 Gbps ethernet connection, and the red ones are powered cords.

            <h3>
               Unifi Access Points
            </h3>
            <p>
               The setup has a Modem to get connected to the Internet, one Unifi Security Gateway, one Unifi PoE Switch 48-Port, several <a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-pro/"> Unifi AC Access Point</a>, several <a href="https://inwall.ui.com/">Unifi AC In-Wall Access Point</a>. The Unifi AC In-Wall Access Point is the Access Point that can be mounted in a wall, where the Unifi AC Access Points cannot be mounted.
            </p>
            <h3>
               Power Over Ethernet (PoE) Cameras
            </h3>
            <p>
               Besides the Access Points, the setup also has several <a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi-video/unifi-video-camera-g3/">PoE Cameras</a>, which are made by Ubiquiti. These cameras are power by PoE, which can be mounted almost anywhere in a building. 
            </p>
            <h3>
               Server Computer
            </h3>
            <p>
               Moreover, the setup has a server computer, which is called Kakaroto Data Center, to host a web server, storage, and Network Video Recording system. The operating system of Kakaroto Data Center is unRaid, which a Unix-like system. unRaid’s user interface is very friendly and easy to use. The unRaid operating system is designed to host multiple virtual machines. Below is the specifications of the Kakaroto Data Center in the setup.

               Unifi Cloud Key
            </h3>
            <p>
               The setup also has the <a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-cloud-key/">Unifi Cloud Key</a> to run a software defined network to control all of the Ubiquiti devices. 
            </p>
            <h3>
               Battery Backup
            </h3>
            <p>
               Networking devices are known to be sensitive with power surge and power outage, to make sure the networking devices are still running on an outage event, these devices are connected to a battery backup which allows all the networking devices continue running during the power outage so that an administrator has enough time to shut down them properly.
            </p>
            <h3>
               In Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
               This is a general Ubiquiti Networks and scalable for a small business infrastructure setup. In other words, as the business grows, more networking devices such as switches, access points and cameras can be added to the existing system without reconfiguring anything.
