               Ubiquiti Unifi Security Gateways (USG)
            </h2>
            <p>
               From the previous <a href="https://ngocdai94.github.io/ap-switch.html">post</a>, I shared about what Unifi Access Point (AP) and Unifi PoE Switches are, and how they have been helping businesses such as schools and coporate companies to achieve a strong infrastructure network more efficient and cost lessly.
            </p>
            <p>
               Having Unifi AP and Unifi PoE Switches are not a complete system. To get networking devices communicating between each others and get connected to the Internet, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications)">Internet Gateway Modem</a> from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is needed. The Internet Gateway Modem, which is connected to the ISP, is generally a data cable from their server. That data cable can be either a coaxial cable, which is also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband_networks">broadband network</a>, or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber">fiber optic</a> cable that can carry more than 100 Gbps data bandwidth. Depending on a service subscription that schools and companies subscribe, the Internet speed will be affected. Of course, higher speed will cost more :).
            </p>
            <p>
               On top of that, security is also needed to ensure that devices inside the schools’ network or coporates’ network are safe and protected from virus and hackers. Ubiquiti Networks also make security routers. Currently, USG and USG Pro are the top products by Ubiquiti Networks. Below is the photo of USG (square) and USG Pro (rectangle).

               At a glance, Unifi Security Gateway Pro has more processor power, more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">Random Access Memory (RAM)</a>, and more ethernet ports to process more clients at the same time. Unifi Security Gateway is a small compact security gateway. It is designed for home and small businesses that have less than 500 clients. In the other hand, USG Pro is bigger and faster, and it is often mounted on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack">network rack</a> along with other networking devices such as switches, server computers, etc.

                Unifi Security Gateway, Unifi PoE Switches, and Unifi Access Points are frequently used together to have a strong infrastructure network.
