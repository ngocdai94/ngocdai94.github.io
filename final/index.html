            Up to now, you probably know a lot about Ubiquiti Enterprise Network products from <a href="https://ngocdai94.github.io/week2/1-ap-switch.html">Ubiquiti Unifi Access Point & Switches</a>, <a href="https://ngocdai94.github.io/week3/index.html">Unifi Security Gateway and How to Set Up?</a>, <a href="https://ngocdai94.github.io/week4/index.html">unRaid Operating System & Virtual Machines</a>, and <a href="https://ngocdai94.github.io/week5/1-docker.html">Dockers</a> blog posts. You also know what software is usually used with those Enterprise networking products. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As I mention before, Enterprise networking products are usually very expensive. To have <a href="https://ngocdai94.github.io/week2/2-usg-setup.html">a similar system</a>, it usually costs at least <strong>$10, 000 USD</strong> to build. Imagine if you are a business owner, who is planning to open a small start-up business and planning to have a powerful Database server to store data and employees’ information, you will probably look for other solutions to build your start-up business due to the initial cost for those enterprise networking products. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Fortunately, to solve this problem, a lot of companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are offering Cloud Services, which helps small startups to set up a strong back-end network infrastructure for their startup. All they need is to have a good Internet connection to those Cloud Services.

                What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Microsoft has <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Azure</a> as its Cloud Computing Services. Google has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a> as its, and Amazon has a cloud computing service called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>. All these cloud services offer real back-end services like Web Hosting servers, virtualization, and database services like MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                These cloud services offer similar solutions to all businesses’ needs. However, as up to date, 2019, Amazon Web Services is the most dominating Cloud Services in the world.

            <h2>Why Amazon Web Services is so strong?</h2>
            <ol id="final">
                <li>Functionalities</li>
                <p>AWS has significantly more services, and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider. The AWS cloud platform offers over 165 fully-featured services, including over 40 services that aren’t offered by any other major cloud provider. AWS provides services for a broad range of applications including compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), security, and application development, deployment, and management.</p>

                <li>Security</li>
                <p>Security is one of the main concerns nowadays. What built by humans can also be cracked by humans. Therefore, no matter how powerful a machine is configured, it is always has a risk to be attacked if an administrator does not pay attention to software updates, and the Internet packets coming in/out from the Internet Gateway. However, with hosting a whole back-end system on the cloud, users can worry-free about those security risks since AWS will constantly update and monitor those packets to prevent hackers. Furthermore, each connection to AWS is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</a> connection. In other words, a connection between client and AWS is encrypted.</p>

                <li>AWS Regions</li>
                <p>AWS has the most data centers around the world. This means that wherever clients go, they can always get accessed to their data instantly since the data is synced across AWS data centers.</p>
                <p>So far AWS has 69 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html">Availability Zones (AZs)</a> within 22 geographic regions around the world and announced plans for 13 more AZs and four more <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html">AWS Regions</a> in Indonesia, Italy, South Africa, and Spain. Figure 1 shows what AWS Regions looks like up to now. </p>

            <h2>Why AWS is more successful than Microsoft Cloud Azure, and Google Cloud Computing?</h2>
            <p>Google Cloud Services and Microsoft Cloud Services have been available before Amazon Web Services. Google Cloud Services and Microsoft Cloud Services were most offered data solutions like Google Drive and OneDrive, respectively. These services aimed mostly to help clients and businesses to have dynamic storage on the cloud wherever they go.</p>
            <p>However, when Amazon started, they started with virtualization on the cloud. In other words, computers on the cloud that can be accessed anywhere in the world. When Amazon first started this solution, it helped a lot of start-up businesses saving a lot of money to invest in strong back-end infrastructure. Instead of investing in those expensive enterprise networking products, clients can use the money to hire more employees to push more productivities. For this reason, a lot of clients back then leveraged AWS to start their businesses.</p>
            <p>When Google and Microsoft see a huge increasing revenue in those cloud services that Amazon is offering, they start to do the same. Google is now having more services on the cloud such as Google Document, Google Excels, Google Drive, etc. Microsoft has been transitioning all its services such as Microsoft Office, Databases, etc. to the cloud. Up to now, Microsoft is a rival to Amazon Web Services. They constantly check each other services every day to ensure that both are offering the same services and competitive prices.</p>
            <p>One of the most successful cloud services from Microsoft is Office 365, in which users can edit documents directly on the cloud, similar to Google Documents. Microsoft is trying to bring its new service called Windows 365 to the cloud that can help users use their own Windows machine on the cloud without buying a very expensive computer.</p>
            <p>Windows 365 is a great idea and a great move by Microsoft. However, I think that it is quite scary to have your own Windows PC on the cloud.  What happened if your cloud computer is hacked? Or What if a government wants to look at your data on the cloud? For these reasons, I do not think it is going to be a great service option for everyone.</p>

            <h2>How to use Amazon AWS?</h2>
            <p>To use Amazon AWS, Amazon requires each user to create an Amazon AWS account. To create an AWS account, you can follow this <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?sc_icampaign=consolesignout_generic_createaccount_cta&sc_ichannel=ha&sc_icontent=awssm-1111&sc_iplace=cta&trk=ha_awssm-1111&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start">sign-up link here</a>. When finishing signing up, you can log in to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?openid.assoc_handle=aws&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fsignin.aws.amazon.com%2Foauth%3Fcoupled_root%3Dtrue%26response_type%3Dcode%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%252Fconsole%252Fhome%253Fnc2%253Dh_ct%2526src%253Dheader-signin%2526state%253DhashArgs%252523%2526isauthcode%253Dtrue%26client_id%3Darn%253Aaws%253Aiam%253A%253A015428540659%253Auser%252Fhomepage&openid.mode=checkid_setup&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&action=&disableCorpSignUp=&clientContext=&marketPlaceId=&poolName=&authCookies=&pageId=aws.login&siteState=registered%2CEN_US&accountStatusPolicy=P1&sso=&openid.pape.preferred_auth_policies=MultifactorPhysical&openid.pape.max_auth_age=120&openid.ns.pape=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fextensions%2Fpape%2F1.0&server=%2Fap%2Fsignin%3Fie%3DUTF8&accountPoolAlias=&forceMobileApp=0&language=EN_US&forceMobileLayout=0&awsEmail=ngocdai94%40gmail.com">AWS Console</a> as shown in Figure 2.</p>

            <figcaption>2. AWS Sign-In Console</figcaption><br>

            <p>When you logged in, the AWS Management Console interface will look like Figure 3 below.</p>
            <img src="/imgs/final-3.jpg" alt="AWS Management Console"><br>
            <figcaption>3. AWS Management Console</figcaption><br>

            <p>At a glance, you could be overwhelmed by how many services that AWS is currently offered. To figure out what services you want to use, you can either talk to an AWS agent or type a keyword in the “find services” box. For example, I am a developer, and I want to find a service that I could do coding online; I can simply type the keyword “code” in the Find box, and AWS will list suggested services as shown in Figure 4 below.

            <figcaption>4. AWS Keywords Find Box</figcaption><br>

            <p>Since I want to build and test code, I will choose CodeBuild service in this case. When in the CodeBuild service as shown in Figure 5, you can watch a tutorial video in the “Get Started” to set up a work project.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In the next few years, cloud computing is going to be the main service. Microsoft and Apple are transitioning their software licenses to software as a service. In other words, most of the software products such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Windows 365, and Windows MySQL Community Server are going to be on the cloud. To use them, users must subscribe to those services either monthly or annually. Lifetime purchase is going to disappear since there is a lot of work to maintain data center such as replacing failure disks, cooling the data center, electricity bills, etc.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, we are going to expect the same thing to hardware as well. For example, Apple has a program called “New iPhone Ever Year.” This means that users pay Apple a monthly fee to rent an iPhone. When a new iPhone comes out, they can trade the old one to get a new one.</p>

            <p>Another example is Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now. Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now are cloud gaming services. Instead of building a very expensive gaming PC to play heavy graphic games with a high frame rate per second (FPS), they can play those games directly on the cloud.</p>

            <p>All these services always rely heavily on the Data Center. For this reason, subscription to use a service is going to be very popular in the future, and make sure you have a reserved big pocket when that time comes :).</p>
