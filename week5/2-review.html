               What most of my blog posts about up to now?
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the last few posts, I talked about Ubiquiti Networks products, which are Unifi Security Gateway, Unifi Power over Ethernet (PoE) Switches, Unifi Access Points (AP), Unifi Security Cameras, and how a general Ubiquiti Network system setup look like. Furthermore, I discussed about unRaid Operating System, which is a Unix-Like operating system, and how important it is to developers, home users, and businesses. Now let’s take a look at how Ubiquiti Networks and unRaid Operating System work together.

            <h2>
                How all Ubiquiti Networks and unRaid OS work together?
            </h2>
            <p>
                From the previous post, I mentioned about Docker containers on unRaid Operating System, and how cool it is in helping IT Technicians and developers reducing the amount of time in installation software on a host machine.
            </p>

            <p>
                Docker also has the containers for Ubiquiti Networks, which are called Unifi Controller to manage Ubiquiti networking devices, and Unifi Video to host and manage Unifi Cameras. To install these two containers, navigate to the APPs tab of the unRaid OS and search for “unifi” in the search box. The Figure 1 below show the result from the search.
            </p>
            <img src="/imgs/review-1.png" alt="Unifi Controller and Unifi Video"><br>
            <figcaption>1. Unifi Controller and Unifi Video</figcaption>

            <p>                
                I would recommend install the latest version of Unifi Controller by <em>linuxserver</em>, and Unifi Video by <em>malvarez00</em> for reliability. To install the Docker, click to the download icon, which is the first one on the icon list. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When the installation finish, the Docker will automatically run. All you have to do is to navigate to the address of the unRaid OS host machine follow by the port number of the Docker container. In my case, I will use the address <b>192.168.1.2:8443</b>. You will be prompted to the setup page. After finishing the setup page, the login page will be as shown below.
            </p>
            <img src="/imgs/review-2.png" alt="Unifi Controller Login Page"><br>
            <figcaption>2. Unifi Controller Login Page</figcaption>

            <p>
                Then, clicking to the device tab to adopt all of the Unifi devices. This process will take between 2 and 5 minutes. When the process complete, the main interface of Unifi Controller will be listed as shown.
            </p>
            <img src="/imgs/review-3.png" alt="Unifi Controller Interface"><br>
            <figcaption>3. Unifi Controller Interface Page</figcaption>

            <p>
                Similar to Unifi Controller, to install Unifi Video, download it from the Docker APPs. The only different is that the port number is not going to be the same as the Unifi Controller. In my case, the port number on the Unifi Video is <b>192.168.1.2:7443</b>. Next, follow the setup prompt to finish the setup, and the login page will appear at shown.
            </p>
            <img src="/imgs/review-4.png" alt="Unifi Video Login Page"><br>
            <figcaption>4. Unifi Video Login Page</figcaption>

            <p>
                After logging in to the Unifi Video, if there are any cameras, the page will ask to adopt the cameras. When the adopting is finished, the page will list all the camera as shown below, and you can name them by any name you want by clicking to a camera. To view live feed from a camera, click LIVE FEED button.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The integration between Ubiquiti Networks and unRaid Operating System with Docker containers is a strong infrastructure network system. It offers small businesses and users an ease of mind when installing Ubiquiti Networks and unRaid OS together.
