                Ubiquiti Unifi Access Points are the top selling products by Ubiquiti. The reason is that the APs are made with high quality electronic components. On top of that, they are affordable for multiple home users and businesses. Ubiquiti is making a lot of <a href="https://store.ui.com/collections/wireless/unifi">Unifi Access Points</a>, but the most common APs that a home user or a business would buy are AP AC Pro or AP AC Lite. The Access Point are powered over ethernet, which is very convenient to install them at any location without worrying about asking a common question, “Where is the nearest electrical outlet?”
            </p>

            <p>
                From the specifications, it is clearly that the AP AC Pro is much faster than the AP AC Lite due to the high throughput on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless bands. According to Ubiquiti, the AP AC Pro can handle more than 250 users at the same time, whereas the AP AC Lite can handle up to 150 users at the same time. With these specifications, the price for AP AC Pro is $146.55 USD, and AP AC Lite is selling at $79.02 USD on <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are a home user and want to improve your WiFi Network, AP AC Lite is a perfect option since it is affordable. If you are more into gaming and streaming a lot with multiple wireless mobile devices at the same time, AP AC Pro is more suitable than AP AC Lite since it has more throughput than the AP AC Lite.
            </p>

            <p>
                For business owners which have a lot of employees in office, AP AC Pro is a good choice since it will ensure that all employees’ mobile devices are receiving airtime fairness and reduce interference among them.

            <h2 id="II">2. Ubiquiti Unifi Powered over Ethernet (PoE) Switches</h2>
            <p>
                Powered over Ethernet (PoE) switches are switches that can power PoE devices. In the last 20 years ago, when schools and businesses want to install an infrastructure network for their campuses, they always must think about where to put an electrical outlet so that it can power Access Points. Imagining putting 100 Access Points (AP) around campuses, there must be at least 60 to 80 electrical outlets nearby to plug all the Access Points. On top of that, all the ethernet cables must be connected between the APs and switches to receive and transfer data. For these reasons, it costs a lot of money for to setup the infrastructure like that. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When PoE came out, it helps a lot of businesses to reduce the cost when building an infrastructure networks for their campuses. There are a lot of PoE switches on market. However, to maintain the same topic on this blog, Unifi PoE Switches is going to be discussed below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Similar to Unifi Access Point, Unifi PoE Switches are made with high electronic components to ensure that they can operate 24/7 and under stress environments such as high temperature. Ubiquiti Networks makes two type of switches. The first one is mini switches, which are used for home and small businesses. The other one is high-capacity switches, which are designed for schools and large businesses that have more than thousands of computers. The photo below shows what mini switches and high capacity switches looks like.

            <p>
                Depending on how many PoE devices that are needed to be powered. Ubiquiti Networks makes a lot of switches accordioning to how many devices that are needed to be powered. For example, Ubiquiti Networks make 60 Wattage (W) and 150W mini switches. To accommodate more wattage devices, Ubiquiti also makes 150W 16-port PoE switches, and up to 750W 48-port PoE switches. Below is the specification of a high capacity switch.

            <p>
                For business owners, getting high-capacity switches is a good option since when the business grows, more computers are needed to connect switch switches. On the other hand, home users should consider to get mini switches since they save a lot of space and they are powerful enough to handle every home users needs.
