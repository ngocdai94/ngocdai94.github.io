            <p>
               From the previous <a href="https://ngocdai94.github.io/week3/2-setup.html">post</a>, I talked about how a general Ubiquiti Networks is setup, which is the combination of Unifi Cloud Key, Unifi Security Gateway, Unifi PoE Switches, Unifi Access Points, Unifi Cameras, and a Server Computer. The server computer is powered by unRaid Operating System, which is getting a lot attention recently.

                <a href="https://unraid.net/">unRaid Operating System</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like">unix-like</a> operating system. In other words, it means that the unRaid OS is created based on a Unix system. Then, developers and software engineers add and remove some feature on the Unix to create a better Unix version. Like other popular Unix systems such as <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspbian</a>, and <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en">RedHat</a>, unRaid OS is fast and reliable due to the operating system size. unRaid OS is specialized in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network Attached Storage (NAS)</a> and virtual machines environment.

             <h2>
                 How To Install unRaid OS?
             </h2>
             <p>
                To install unRaid OS, a minimum 16 Gigabyte of USB storage is required. However, to ensure unRaid OS not running out of storage, 32 Gigabyte of USB storage is recommended. unRaid OS is flexible and can be transferred to any host machine by plugging the USB to it. 
             </p>

             <p>
                The unRaid team makes the installation process easier than the past. Users can visit the <a href="https://unraid.net/download">unRaid Download</a> page to download a software, USB Creator, to create a bootable USB. Then, choosing the boot order on a host machine to boot to the USB and finishing the installation process. When the installation is finished, the user interface of unRaid OS will look like the photo below.
             </p>
